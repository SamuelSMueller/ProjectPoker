Familiarize self with Github/Git commands
Create Repo
Look at similar projects what (and why) others have done things the way they have (i.e. Fibonacci Sequence)
Decide what features I want, what features are implied by having those features
Wireframe/mockup for project GUI, add notes for specific features/functions
Decide what tools I will be using (C++ is strongest language, find good GUI engine/IDE for C++ -> QT)
Install QT, research basic functions and creation of GUI applications
Link project folder to git repo
Begin programming, learn to make one window appear
Add buttons to main window (incorrect?)
Buttons appear to be incorrect size and window is too small
Research layout functionality and best-use practices for user input (textfield/buttons - signal and slot concepts)
